## User Experience (UX)

### Key information for the site

1. Users can create a unique account to securely store their notes.
2. The app allows users to create, view, edit, and delete their notes at any time.
3. Notes are sorted by default from the newest created to the oldest.
4. The app is accessible on multiple devices and platforms, allowing users to access their notes on-the-go.
5. The app consists of social media links where users can follow or contact the developer.

### User Stories

1. First-time user: As a first time user, I want to easily create a new account on the note app, so I can start creating, viewing, editing, and deleting notes. I also want to be able to quickly and intuitively navigate through the note app, so I can easily find the features I need to use and efficiently manage my notes.

2. Frequent user: As a frequent user, I want to be able to easily access my notes from my previous sessions so that I can quickly pick up where I left off and continue my work. I also want to be able to edit, delete, and create new notes when I wish to do so.

### Future Implementations



### Accessibility

It was ensured that the website is accessible and as user-friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Following heading hierarchy.
* Implementing *Tab* friendly navigation for links.
* Using hover effects on all buttons and links to inform the user they are hovering on a button.
* Complying with colour contrast guidelines (Aa).

## Testing

Please refer to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file for full testing procedure.

### Fixed Bugs

1. When creating a note, there is a minimum number of characters required to create it. However, when editing the note, I noticed I was able to remove all contents from note title and description with no errors. This was later fixed to match create note requirements.
